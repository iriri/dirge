//! Per-line content hashes for hash-anchored editing.
//!
//! Hash-anchored editing (see `edit_lines`) lets a model edit a file
//! by line *range* plus a tiny per-line content hash instead of
//! reproducing the exact old text. `read(line_metadata=true)` shows the
//! hash beside each line; the model echoes the hashes for the range
//! it wants to replace, and the edit tool recomputes them from disk
//! and rejects the edit if any line drifted. The hash is a *guard*
//! (did this line change since you read it?), not a locator — lines
//! are addressed by number, the hash only confirms.
//!
//! Why 3 hex chars: the model has to read and echo these, so they
//! must be short. 12 bits (4096 buckets) per line is cheap on tokens,
//! but a single drifted line has a ~1/4096 chance of hashing to the
//! value the model echoed, and across a multi-line range those odds
//! accumulate — a silent clobber of the exact content the guard exists
//! to protect (dirge-w9q9).
//!
//! To buy back the safety without widening the echoed hash, each line
//! is hashed together with its PREDECESSOR. A single line drifting then
//! perturbs TWO adjacent hashes — its own (as the content) and the next
//! line's (as that line's predecessor) — so slipping a stale edit past
//! the guard needs two independent 12-bit collisions (~1/16.7M) for all
//! but a range's final line, instead of one. The coupling stays LOCAL
//! (only the immediate successor is affected), so an edit elsewhere in
//! the file is never spuriously rejected. `read` and `edit_lines` both
//! derive the predecessor from the real adjacent file line, so their
//! hashes agree.
//!
//! The function is FNV-1a (32-bit) folded to 12 bits and is stable
//! forever — it must not depend on a process-random seed, or a hash
//! shown by one `read` call wouldn't match the next.
